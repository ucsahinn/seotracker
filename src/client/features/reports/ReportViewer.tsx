/**
 * The only place the app renders model-written HTML, in the app and on the
 * public share page. Everything that keeps it safe is the `sandbox` attribute
 * plus the CSP the document response sets; the token list is shared with that
 * header so a link behaves the same framed and top-level, and
 * `allow-same-origin` is never added.
 *
 * Framed, the document is served byte for byte — the app injects nothing here.
 * The only injection is the print script on `?print=1`, which this viewer
 * never requests.
